# Captionify
## Image Captioning with CNN, and RNN
This is an image captioning project that uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to generate captions for images. 
The project involves training CNN(VGG16), and RNN models on the Flickr8k and 30k datasets to understand the context of images and generate relevant captions. 
The generated captions can be viewed in a Streamlit app that is also included in the repository.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.7, TensorFlow, Keras and Streamlit

### Usage
#### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
``` git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning.git ```
#### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
``` cd captionify ```
#### 3. Launch the Streamlit app:
``` streamlit run captionify.py ```
#### 4. Upload an image to the app and view the generated captions.
### Notes
Features, Vocabulary and Model are also available with colab code used to train them
